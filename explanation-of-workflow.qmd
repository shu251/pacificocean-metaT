# Compilation of eukrhythmic output

## run_tximport.R

Script takes output from salmon counts and modifies for the gene length across all samples. The outcome will be the transcript-level estimates. 

Output file is *tximport_metaT-ALOHA-CA.Rdata*


# List of Rdata files

1. `tximport_metaT-ALOHA-CA.Rdata` - output from `run_tximport.R`. Items include `txi` and `sample_merged`. These can be directly input into DESeq functions.

2. `Avg_scaled_tpm_08222023.RData` - from the tximport library, we can use the function "makeCountsFromAbundance" to generate scaledTPM outputs. Since columns include replicates, we averaged the scaled TPM across replicate samples to generate `mean_counts_df`.

3. `normed_center_df_08222023.RData` - includes `df_ctr_norm` dataframe that used the variance stabilizing transformation (vst) to estimate dispersion from the DESeq object. 

4. `zscore_outputs.RData` = includes z-score scaled data, after removal of transcripts that appeared in only 1 sample and that added to less than 10. Z-score transformation with replicates and without replicates (averaged across replicates first).


5. kmeans

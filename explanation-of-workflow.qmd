# Compilation of eukrhythmic output

Output from eukrhythmic is processed in the `process-eukrhythmic-output` script. This starts with compilation scripts and then goes into a series of generating count files that will be necessary for downstream analysis. 


# List of Rdata files

1. `tximport_metaT-ALOHA-CA.Rdata` - output from `run_tximport.R`. Items include `txi` and `sample_merged`. These can be directly input into DESeq functions.


2. Transformed and scaled data.

`rlog_formatted_forlocaluse.RData`
`vst_formatted_forlocaluse.RData`


PREVIOUSLY: Avg_scaled_tpm_08222023.RData`
2. `TPM-count-tables.RData` - from the tximport library, we can use the function "makeCountsFromAbundance" to generate scaledTPM outputs. Since columns include replicates, we averaged the scaled TPM across replicate samples to generate `mean_counts_df`. A TPM table with replicates is also included.


4. `zscore_outputs.RData` - includes z-score scaled data, after removal of transcripts that appeared in only 1 sample and that added to less than 10. After filtering transcripts, TPM was averaged across replicates. Then the Z-score transformation was done (`scale()`). This was combined with the annotation information and saved.


5. kmeans
